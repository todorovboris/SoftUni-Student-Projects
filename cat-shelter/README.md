# Overview

- It is a JS back-end student project, which main goal is to practice creating a server, using 'http' module (WITHOUT Express and templating); basic communication between client and server
- "Cat Shelter" is a very simple cat catalog that shows the "database" (JSON file) of some cat shelter and everyone (registration is not required) user can be their potential owner. The application will consist of the basic CRUD operations (Create cat, Read cat, Update cat and Delete cat). Each cat has a name, description, image and breed.

## Functionality
-   Create cat breed which later can be picked when a new cat is added to the shelter
-   Create a new cat, which has a name, description, image and breed
-   All cats must be saved in a JSON file (that will be our database)
-   List all cats from the "database" no matter the breed
-   Edits cat's information. Changes must be persisted in "database"
-   Deletes specific cat from database. Changes must be persisted in "database"
-   Search in cat "database" by some query string and shows the results if any
